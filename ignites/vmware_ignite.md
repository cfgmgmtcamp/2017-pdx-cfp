## Presentation Title
VMware ecosystem in 5 minutes

## Abstract
VMware is everywhere. But most people think it's just ESXi and maybe vCenter on
top of it. Watching this talk will give you a quick understanding of how
the VMware ecosystem has grown. Along with the growth, multiple rebranding and
name changes has caused confusion. If you're boss is thinking about purchasing
vRA/vRO/NSX/vCAC/vSAN/vCAir for half of your IT budget and you don't know what
it is, this talk aims to give you clarity here.n

VMware isn't just ESXi anymore, the growth of this platform is mind boggling and
clarity is required to make informed decisions for your business.
