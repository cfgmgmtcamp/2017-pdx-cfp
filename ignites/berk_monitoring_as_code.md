## Monitoring as Code


## Abstract

Configuration management tools encourage us to automate everything, but what comes after your servers and applications are up and running? Monitoring is a key part of each deployment. However, often we tend to let it slide. One reason is the effort it takes us to create even basic health checks. In private and public clouds servers and services appear and disappear in a fast frequency. In containerized environments, the amount of changes is even higher. You shouldnâ€™t have to react manually on those. Rather, monitoring should be a crucial part of your automation process. Icinga 2 offers many ways to integrate in your infrastructure. My ignite will cover various techniques how you can automate your monitoring by using the REST API, configuration management tools, or Icingas very own modules.
