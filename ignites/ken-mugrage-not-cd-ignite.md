## Presentation Title

It's not Continuous Delivery if you can't deploy right now

## Abstract

People often say that they’re practicing continuous delivery, and then add something like “I can let the security team know any time” or “I just have to run the performance tests.” Ken Mugrage explains why you’re not done with your continuous delivery journey if you can’t push your software to production right now. Along the way, Ken explores code management strategies, deployment patterns, and types of continuous delivery pipelines you can use to make sure you can deploy right now.
