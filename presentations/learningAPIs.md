## Starting with APIs in 25-35 minutes


## Abstract

As a systems administrator, beginner developer, or DevOps Engineer, you find
yourself using APIs. Imagine your boss tells you to build an app between a
legacy API and a new REST API.  You have never built an API client and have
no idea where to start, but you need to ramp up quickly.

This talk will give you the foundation to work with APIs to get the information
to where you boss needs it.  First of all, what is an API?  Second, why would
we want to work with them?  Third, how can we use Ruby to get the information
from one API into another API?  Finally, you will also learn some common initial
stumbling blocks and how to work through them. You will walk away knowing both
what an API is and how to get up to speed and working with them very quickly.

From this talk, you'll see that Ruby isn't scary, learn most APIs have a good
amount of information and with only a little bit of work you can exercise them
to get initial projects built.
