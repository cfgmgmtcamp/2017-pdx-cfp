## Presentation Title
Transform Your Organization Like a Jedi, You Should

## Abstract
What Would Yoda Do? DevOps transformation is about people. not tools. In order to transform your organization, you will have to know people and how they work. Luckily for us, people are pretty predictable and easily influenced… if you know how. Using my many years of social engineering and social psychology, I’ll share with you tricks of the social engineering trade that will allow you to successfully transform your organization and the people within. We’ll cover influence, non-verbals / body language, reciprocation, consistency, and much, much more! Join me for some practical Jedi mind-tricks you can employ with ease!
