## How to Build a CD Pipeline for Systems

## Abstract

My talk would be vendor neutral and cover how a CD pipeline works and
what all the different pieces are and how to put them together. While
being neutral to a solution, I will give practical advice on commonly
used software to achieve each stage of the pipeline with the goal of
managing systems, not just releasing software.
