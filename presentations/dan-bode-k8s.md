## Presentation Title

Configuration Management -> Container Scheduling

## Abstract

After spending several years automating application deployments
with Puppet, I've transitioned to Kubernetes.

This presentation will compare and contrast configuration
management with container scheduling. It will describe which
problems are better solved by which tools, the advantages of
containers for application deployments, and the lessons that
containers can learn from the config management ecosytem.

It will conclude by exploring how the devops role needs to
evolve in order to better support application deployments.
