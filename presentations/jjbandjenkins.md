## Jenkins and the JJB (and Chef)


## Abstract

JJ will spend some time showing off how to get the JJB working in your environment. He'll discuss what
the JJB is, a little history around it, some crazy examples, and then build it from scratch live. The JJB
is extremely powerful, but getting the thing to work out of the gate is extremely hard. JJ'll make it
simple and so you can take it home/work and use it in your environment.
