## Deploying a Multi-Service App in Kubernetes


## Abstract

This session will detail how to deploy a multi-service application in Kubernetes, using Pulp as the example. Pulp is a multi-service web application that manages repositories of content, such as software packages, and makes it available for installation. With a REST API, async worker processes, a scheduler process, and a service to curate job queues, Pulp is a natural fit for the orchestration provided by Kubernetes.

In this session, you will learn:
- How to deploy a multi-service application in Kubernetes
- How to manage shared configuration and secrets for a “pre-docker” app that was not designed for container deployment
- How to share persistent storage across multiple services
- How to scale individual services to meet changing load
