## Infrastructure as Code... on Windows? Making it happen both technically and culturally with Otter

## Abstract

Infrastucuture as code on Windows is possible, but how can it be done both technically and culturally?.  This presentation will focus on how to implement IaC within your organization with little to no friction or resistance.  By focusing on the specific scenario of managing configuration within a Windows development environment (i.e. build servers, build agents, developer desktops, source control servers and ALM servers).  The presentation and demos will use an infrastructure-as-code tool called [Otter]( http://inedo.com/otter), which is specifically designed for managing Windows environments.  It provides a near trivial installation, visual GUI, and also the depth of complex orchestrations and dependencies.  

Topics covered:
* The problem of configuration drift in the development environment
* Core concepts of Otter
* Drift remediation demo
* Demo how to build plans using OtterScript
* Demo how to create types of resources
