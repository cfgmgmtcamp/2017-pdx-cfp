## Native Software Repository Management with Pulp


## Abstract

Organize the software you need, packaged in its native format, with Pulp. Pulp gives you one tool that can manage repositories of software in many formats, such as Python packages, Puppet modules, Docker images, RPMs, Debian packages, and more.

In this session, you will learn how to:
- Mirror content from a remote source such as the Python Package Index, Puppet Forge, or any yum repository.
- Create your own repositories and upload content.
- Take control of your application’s (changing) dependencies by storing on-site copies, organized into Pulp repositories that match your application’s lifecycle.
- Use Pulp as a pull-through persistent cache to access remote content on-demand.
