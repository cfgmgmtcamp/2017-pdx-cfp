# Building Better Chef Community Cookbooks

# Abstract

With 3,000 cookbooks on the Supermarket it sometimes feels like there's 3,000 different ways to write a cookbook. Attributes vs. resources. Definitions vs. Custom Resources. Bats vs. ServerSpec vs. InSpec. What exactly makes a good community cookbook and how can cookbooks be written in a way to makes them more reusable in differing environments?

In this talk we'll look at how community cookbooks differ from those you write for your own organization. We'll dive into a bit of history showing different cookbook design methods that have been used throughout the eight year history of Chef. Then we'll talk about building community cookbooks that are reusable and how you can use those methods to improve the community cookbooks you write.
