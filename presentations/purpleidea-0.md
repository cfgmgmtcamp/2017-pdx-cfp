## Next Generation Config Mgmt: Autonomous systems

## Abstract

[Mgmt](https://github.com/purpleidea/mgmt/) is a next gen config management tool that takes a fresh look at existing automation problems.

Three of the main design features of the tool include:
* Parallel execution
* Event driven mechanism
* Distributed architecture

This presentation will briefly introduce the tool and spend most of the time presenting and demoing some of the newer features in the project.
We'll present some of the new resources (virt, password, etc) new features (libified mgmt, send/recv, DSL) and how these can be used to build autonomous systems.
Finally we'll talk about some of the future designs we're planning and make it easy for new users to get involved and help shape the project.
