## Next Generation Config Mgmt: Extras, Internals and Future

## Abstract

[Mgmt](https://github.com/purpleidea/mgmt/) is a next gen config management tool that takes a fresh look at existing automation problems.
This presentation will briefly introduce the tool and spend most of the time presenting and demoing some of the newer features in the project.
We'll start by explaining and demoing all of the metaparameters in mgmt.
Next we'll dive into some of the internals of the project for new contributors who want to write their first resource.
Finally we'll talk about some of the future designs we're planning and make it easy for new users to get involved and help shape the project.

This presentation would pair extremely well with the talk that I proposed for DevOpsDays PDX, or with the [other session](purpleidea-0.md) that I also submitted to this CFP.
