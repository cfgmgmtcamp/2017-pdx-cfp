After he grew tired of commuting to work every day wearing a parka while doing desktop support in Antarctica Tim jumped into web operations. Since then he's worked to ensure your web analytics are always accurate, your streaming TV shows never buffer, and your rent checks are always on time. He now works for Chef on the Community Team improving community cookbooks.
