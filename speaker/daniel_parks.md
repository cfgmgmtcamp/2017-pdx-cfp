## Bio

Daniel Parks worked as a system administrator at Puppet until he got pushed into
management for using plusignment too much. Before Puppet his life was full of
sadness because he managed servers by hand and built web stores in PHP.

When he's not managing, he's writing code, and when he's not writing code he's
playing improv games.
